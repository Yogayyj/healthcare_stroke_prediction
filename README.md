healthcare analytics: stroke prediction 

Stroke is a common disease in society and a major cause of death. Because of the prevalence of stroke's adverse effects in society, it brings the need to enhance diagnostic and management strategies. With the development of technologies and management skills, healthcare professionals now have tools to optimize patient care and generate more revenue through health data. In this research paper, we carefully examined different variables of the dataset to enhance stroke prediction accuracy. The implementation of machine learning models and statistical models will help to predict the risk of stroke by using various factors to help healthcare agencies make strategic decisions. Our findings determine that age, gender, average glucose level, work type, residence type and smoking status stand out as primary indicators for identifying stroke risks in patients.
